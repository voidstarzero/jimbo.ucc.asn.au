        <p>The talk series has now concluded. Thanks to everyone who came!</p>
        <p>I will be uploading the remaining sets of slides when I get time
        over the next few weeks, and then will probably revise them to
        include more information helpful for anyone following along at
        home.</p>

        <h2>Build an Internet from the Ground Up</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>In 50 years, the Internet has gone from a connection between a
          handful of computers in the US, to an everyday part of life for
          billions of people. But the "core" of the internet, the domain of
          Internet Service Providers and multinational companies, remains
          fairly unknown. Just how is it that data gets from your phone at UWA
          to Google in Sydney, or from your home router in Mt Lawley to a
          Minecraft server in Los Angeles?</p>
          <p>Join us for a series of workshops as we build a small scale-model
          of the Internet in the clubroom, complete with its own ISPs, domain
          names and "UCC wide web". Along the way, we'll explore the
          technologies and protocols that make the Internet what it is today,
          from the more visible — like HTTP and DNS — to the more specialized
          but no less important — like SMTP and BGP.</p>
