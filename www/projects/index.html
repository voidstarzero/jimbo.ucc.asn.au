        <p>My setup for <a href="//jimbo.ucc.asn.au/">my website</a> currently
        piggy-backs off the infrastructure run by the
        <a href="//www.ucc.asn.au/">University Computer Club</a>.</p>
        <p>This particular site was made with a goal of using modern web
        features to build a lightweight but functional site. It is responsive
        and solely uses HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p>Its configuration and source has now been posted on

        Ground Up">
        <h2>Build an Internet from the Ground Up</h2>
        <p>I recently ran a series of tech talks at the
        <a href="//www.ucc.asn.au/">University Computer Club</a> entitled
        <em>Build an Internet from the Ground Up</em>, where we worked hands on
        with a set of ARM single-board computers to build a small
        "Internet-like" network and experiment with real-world protocols.</p>
        <p>Here is the synopsis from the initial event announcement:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>In 50 years, the Internet has gone from a connection between a
          handful of computers in the US, to an everyday part of life for
          billions of people. But the "core" of the internet, the domain of
          Internet Service Providers and multinational companies, remains
          fairly unknown. Just how is it that data gets from your phone at UWA
          to Google in Sydney, or from your home router in Mt Lawley to a
          Minecraft server in Los Angeles?</p>
          <p>Join us for a series of workshops as we build a small scale-model
          of the Internet in the clubroom, complete with its own ISPs, domain
          names and "UCC wide web". Along the way, we'll explore the
          technologies and protocols that make the Internet what it is today,
          from the more visible &mdash; like HTTP and DNS &mdash; to the more
          specialized but no less important &mdash; like SMTP and BGP.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>You can find slides, summaries, and other relevant information from
        the talks over at the <a href="/projects/byoi/">project page</a>.</p>
